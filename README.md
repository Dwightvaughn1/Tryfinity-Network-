# Trisolidex Resonance Matrix

_Research framework and simulation tools for resonance-based space-time mapping, hashing, and coherence analysis._

## About
The Trisolidex framework simulates resonance chains, coherence indexing, and rotating-universe dynamics. Rooted in the original work published in *The Book of Ike Volume 2* by Dwight R. Vaughn, this repository provides reproducible notebooks for testing and extending the resonance matrix.

## Features
- Resonance hashing and R-Calc
- Multi-dimensional coherence chain simulation
- Rotating universe toy model
- Extensible Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/trisolidex.git
cd trisolidex
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Trisolidex: Resonance Matrix Simulation Framework

## Overview

Trisolidex is a **4D resonance matrix simulation framework** designed to process multi-modal sensor data (light, electromagnetic, acceleration) into a **coherent space-time model**.  
It computes local coherence (R), identifies stable cells, and encodes them into reproducible signatures for pattern analysis, simulation, or prediction.  

This work is **rooted in 30+ years of original research**, published in *The Book of Ike, Volume 2*. All components are **fully reproducible and timestamped**.

## Features

1. **Normalization:** Convert sensor data into Hz/time bins.  
2. **Grid Mapping:** Map data into 4D trisolidex coordinates (t, x, y, z).  
3. **Coherence Calculation:** Compute local order parameter R for neighborhoods.  
4. **Stable Cell Selection:** Identify regions with high coherence.  
5. **Signature Encoding:** Hash stable cells for reproducibility.  
6. **Rotating Universe Test:** Optional simulation of universe rotation effects.
