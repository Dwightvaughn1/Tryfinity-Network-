# Trisolidex Resonance Matrix

_Research framework and simulation tools for resonance-based space-time mapping, hashing, and coherence analysis._

## About
The Trisolidex framework simulates resonance chains, coherence indexing, and rotating-universe dynamics. Rooted in the original work published in *The Book of Ike Volume 2* by Dwight R. Vaughn, this repository provides reproducible notebooks for testing and extending the resonance matrix.

## Features
- Resonance hashing and R-Calc
- Multi-dimensional coherence chain simulation
- Rotating universe toy model
- Extensible Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/trisolidex.git
cd trisolidex
pip install -r requirements.txt
